My journey began in 1982 at a Moscow train station. By train and ship, I reached Japan three weeks later — a country that fascinated me so deeply that I decided to stay and learn the language. Always with me: my camera.

Through photography I found my way to documentary filmmaking - increasingly digitized in the nineties. At the same time, the Internet became ever more important. I was captivated by how it all worked and started programming.

After more than ten years in software development, my journey finally led to technology journalism at Swiss Radio and Television (SRF), where I produced contributions for radio programs, podcasts and wrote online articles until my retirement in autumn 2025.

Now I create educational videos for a university. The paths taken before seem to converge: visual arts, technology, and storytelling. The journey that began fourty-odd years ago in Moscow still continues.
